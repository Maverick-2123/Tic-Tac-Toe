# Tic-Tac-Toe
I have created a simple Tic Tac Toe game and it works and I am also working on other variants of this game like which includes Score Meter or Reset Button.
Python 3 must be installed on your system.
Tkinter module must be installed.
Generally Tkinter is pre-installed but if not, in CMD, write code "pip install tkinter". (Without the inverted commas :))
